# About me

My name is Prakash Dhungana and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering majoring in Computer Engineering at University of Kentucky. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Sayed Ahmad Salehi. My primary research objective is to pledge robust and reliable training and inference of ML models for embedded platforms in real-time scenarios. Ultimately, I aim to create innovative solutions that empower these models to excel despite constraints, improving their ability to adapt and perform well in dynamic environments. I am planning to take my oral qualifying examination during the Fall of 2024, most probably in early November.
